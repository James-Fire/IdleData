BUGS:

Contracts basically cancel themselves when you save/load and stop doing anything.

Copy/Paste doesn't work



BALANCE:

Cost pass

Contract payment pass



QOL:

Contract "Idle" replaced with actual reasons.

Add time remaining to contract tooltips

Save screen can save over existing save

Text size also scales with zoom

Selecting a rack while it's selected and it's components are blown out will unselect it



OPTIMIZATION:

Make nodes cached

Cache power consumption

Make variables and functions local that don't need to be global

Split out connections into their various types so we iterate over less useless things



NEW FEATURES:

Tiers

Servers with GPU compute built-in

SSDs and HDDs are different storage pools

Contracts scale with your capacity

Contracts can be renewed

Combine contracts, give them work definitions instead. Payment is per work definition rather than completing the whole thing

Make GPU compute a standalone work definition from CPU
