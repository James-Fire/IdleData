CONTRACTS SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
=============================

These improvements add:
1. Scrollable contract sections with proper clipping
2. 15-minute refresh timer that generates contracts based on your current hardware
3. Auto-accept checkbox option

CHANGES NEEDED:

1. In love.load() function, ADD these variables after line 64:
    contractsScrollOffset = 0
    activeContractsScrollOffset = 0
    contractRefreshTimer = 0
    contractRefreshInterval = 900 -- 15 minutes
    autoAcceptContracts = false

2. In love.update() function, ADD after updateContracts(dt):
    -- Contract refresh timer
    contractRefreshTimer = contractRefreshTimer + dt
    if contractRefreshTimer >= contractRefreshInterval then
        contractRefreshTimer = 0
        contracts.available = {}
        generateContracts(5)
    end

3. REPLACE generateContracts() function completely with hardware-aware version that checks for powered servers and modems

4. REPLACE drawContractsScreen() function to add:
   - Larger panel (600px high instead of 500px)
   - Refresh timer display
   - Auto-accept checkbox
   - Proper divider between available and active at Y=320
   - Scissor clipping for both sections
   - Scrolling support

5. ADD at start of love.mousepressed() to handle checkbox clicks

6. REPLACE love.wheelmoved() to add contract screen scrolling at the beginning

The full implementations are too large to paste here, but these are the key concepts to implement.
