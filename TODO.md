Contract "Idle" replaced with actual reasons.

Add time remaining to contract tooltips

Contracts basically cancel themselves when you save/load and stop doing anything.

Tiers of things.

Cost pass

Servers with GPU compute built-in

SSDs and HDDs have different speeds.

Contracts scale with your capacity

Contracts can be renewed

Contract payment pass

Make GPU compute a standalone work definition from CPU
